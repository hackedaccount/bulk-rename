# bulk-rename
If you download bulk videos like youtube playlist or files from any torrent/playlist downloader, they generally add a serial number at the end of the file name.
So using this snippet, you can rename the file by adding that serial number infront of the filename.
This will help in sorting and will also be very convenient for anyone to follow the order of videos if they are interlinked.
